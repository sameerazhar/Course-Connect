C is a programming language developed at AT & T’s Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972. It was designed and written by a
man named Dennis Ritchie. In the late seventies C began to replace the more familiar languages of that time like PL/I,
ALGOL, etc. No one pushed C. It wasn’t made the ‘official’ Bell Labs language. Thus, without any advertisement C’s reputation
spread and its pool of users grew. Ritchie seems to have been rather surprised that so many programmers preferred C to older
languages like FORTRAN or PL/I, or the newer ones like Pascal and APL. But, that's what happened.

Possibly why C seems so popular is because it is reliable, simple and easy to use. Moreover, in an industry where newer languages,
tools and technologies emerge and vanish day in and day out, a language that has survived for more than 3 decades has to be really
good.

Communicating with a computer involves speaking the language the computer understands, which immediately rules out English as
the language of communication with computer. However, there is a close analogy between learning English language and learning C
language. The classical method of learning English is to first learn the alphabets used in the language, then learn to combine these
alphabets to form words, which in turn are combined to form sentences and sentences are combined to form paragraphs.
